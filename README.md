READ.ME - Wine Quality Prediction

WineQualityPrediction.ipynb: Our project is all based into this file, with cells and comments divided into sections 
for readability and runnability. Please run the cells in order, starting with the first cell to import the necessary files for our project. 
Each cell is divided with comments and expected outputs to check for correctness of runnability.

The execution environment that we used for the majority of our project is through Jupyter Notebook. 
We ran the project through our group’s COLAB using Python 3.10, as well as several libraries listed below:

Imported libraries: 
kagglehub: Streamlined datasets from our Kaggle Datasets
os: Imported to interact with our files and/or running commands
requests: Accesses APIs/web content related to our Kaggle datasets
pandas: Manipulating our data for cleaning and preprocessing/data analysis
zipfile: Creating/Extracting zip files
numpy: Number and data manipulation

For the specifics of our machines, we’ve also imported the usage of sklearn.

sklearn.svm: Imported SVM
sklearn.neural_network: Imported Neural Network
